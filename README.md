# Gravitational-Wave-Inference
Bayesian Inference on Gravitational Waves
## This colab notebook serves two purposes. 
1) It is part of my Presentation on Gravitational Waves
2) It exercises **Advanced Analytics** which I will transfer to ML Volatility Analysis

The **Advanced Analytics** includes:
1) **Baysean Statistical Analysis**
2) **Spectral Analysis** from Time Series to Frequency Domain
3) **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** to determine parameters

I am examining **wavelets** as an improvement on the FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms) in **Spectral Analysis**
