# Einstein Gravity, The Foundation of Cosmology's Century
Presented to The Albuquerque Astronomical Society on October 23, 2021

What does General Relativity have to do with Data Science? Both Quant Finance and Data Science is pushed forward by Researchers with a Physics Background. This Repository on General Relativity and Gravitational Wave Detection demonstrates leading edge analytical approaches such as **Spectral Analysis" to tease out the signal from the noise. This also captures any periodic behavior.

# Gravitational-Wave-Inference
Bayesian Inference on Gravitational Waves with **Advanced Analytics**
## This colab notebook serves two purposes. 
1) It is part of my Presentation on Gravitational Waves
2) It exercises **Advanced Analytics** which I will transfer to ML Volatility Analysis

The **Advanced Analytics** includes:
1) **Baysean Statistical Analysis**
2) **Spectral Analysis** from Time Series to Frequency Domain
3) **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** to determine parameters

I am examining **wavelets** as an improvement on the FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms) in **Spectral Analysis**

Notebook to be added at end of May
